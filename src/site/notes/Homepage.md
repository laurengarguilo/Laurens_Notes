Welcome to my digital notebook! I'm Lauren, an undergraduate college student and future Psychology Researcher. I am currently in my third year (skipped a year) of college studying in the majors of [[Psychology\|Psychology]] and [[Digital Media\|Digital Media]], as well as in a minor of [[Business\|Business]].

My classes for this term are [[Intro to Business Concepts\|Intro to Business Concepts]], [[Writing for Digital Media\|Writing for Digital Media]], and [[Survey of Digital Media\|Survey of Digital Media]]. Check out the links for weekly updates on my schoolwork.

Aside from school, I volunteer 5-10 hours a week and I am currently working on a personal research project, which I have titled "[[Theory of Productivity\|Theory of Productivity]]."
